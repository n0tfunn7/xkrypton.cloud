Hello there far and wonderous internet traveler! You have stumbled upon my personal website! Now don't be worried.. you won't need to read a lot here. This site simply serves as whatever I want it to be. A cool email domain.. heck yea! A portfolio.. heck yea. *Or it could even be a blank page collecting dust!!* **How exciting is that?!**


# About Me

I am *Krypton*, *n0tfunn7*, or any other random alias that doesn't make sense that I pick in the future. I like **tech** and I like having **fun**. That is either a great combination or a god awful one. I'll let you be the judge ðŸ˜¯

## What will I mainly be running on this website?

The main purpose of this website is to serve as a **personal journal**. I've heard that the best way to learn is to teach so I guess that's what we'll be doing most of the time. Sit tight and hold your horses. Now keep in mind that I am keeping this as a journal for myself **so I might not be the most accurate**.


# TL:DR

Ooooh. Mr. Not So Smarty Pants doesn't like to read. I'll keep it short and simple for you.

I am *Krypton* and I am running this website to keep as a **personal journal** of mine. Most topics will be tech related.
